# California wildfire map

This project for my Climate Systems class at Columbia shows a map of wildfires in California over time. The map is interactive and updates the data displayed based on the year selected via a slider.

The map is created using Bokeh for Python and hosted live with Heroku. I started the project in a Jupyter notebook but moved to a server-based app so that I could use the callbacks in Python.
